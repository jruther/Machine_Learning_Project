# Machine_Learning_Project
This repository contains an assessment of the 'Boston House Price' dataset for the 4th semester 5 credit module - Machine Learning & Statistics, part of the course entitled Higher Diploma in Science - Computing (Data Analytics), submitted to Dr. Ian McLoughlin, lecturer and Programme Administrator at GMIT. The analyses contained with this repository are as per the assignment direction and are answered in the order in which they were asked. A number of sources of reference material was used and reviewed in this analysis, and a list of referenced sites is found at the end of the page.
The analysis is carried out with the use of a Jupyter Notebook, which can be run directly in the git hub respository or downloaded, as preferred.  All the images in the note book are embedded using the recommended relative path to the 'Image' directory in the parent folder.  For convenience we have included a pdf version of our notebook, should the images fail to load.
